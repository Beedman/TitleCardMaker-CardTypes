## Description

These are modification of the [StandardTitleCard](https://github.com/CollinHeist/TitleCardMaker/wiki/StandardTitleCard). The standardcard uses the different font, font sizes and the episode title is positioned lower than the StandardTitleCard. The absolutecard uses the same fonts and sizes but hides the seasons and has the episode count positioned in the left top corner, the episode titles are positioned even lower than the standardcard.
