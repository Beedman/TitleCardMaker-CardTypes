# BetterStandardTitleCard
## Description
This is an example custom CardType mainly meant to showcase the ability to remotely load card types. It's an intentionally bad-looking modification of the [StandardTitleCard](https://github.com/CollinHeist/TitleCardMaker/wiki/StandardTitleCard).

### Features
I am not sure you can call these _features_, per-se, but below is a description of the CardType:

- Uses the Comic Sans font (and doesn't permit customization)
- Has a wonderfully vibrant yellow font
- Randomly blurs the source image (for some added variety!)
- Reverses the title (because why not)
- Randomly adjusts the spacing of the season text
- Randomly adjusts the size of the title text
